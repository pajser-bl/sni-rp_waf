# sni-rp_waf

A shitty collage project on WAF
(Web Application Firewall) written in golang. Works as a simple funnel(white/blacklist by IP, 
catches XSS and SQL injections using regular expressions) and reverse-proxy server for three web applications with SSO.

## Project contains three more repo-s, ugly as sin:
* (user CRUD) - https://github.com/pajser-bl/sni-admin (attempt was made)
* (article CRUD) - https://github.com/pajser-bl/sni-manager (unfinished)
* (shopping cart) - https://github.com/pajser-bl/sni-shop (not started)
* (echo server) - https://github.com/pajser-bl/echo_server (used for debugging, pls don't use find better)

As I have passed said university course this project is here just a testament to my first attempt at golang.
